# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Personal Finance Dashboard is a full-stack TypeScript application that provides users with a comprehensive view of their financial data. The system aggregates information from multiple sources including currency exchange rates, stock market data, and transaction records to present a unified dashboard experience. This project demonstrates real-world client value by solving the common problem of scattered financial information across multiple platforms.

1. WHEN the user loads the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display total balance, recent transactions, and portfolio value
2. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL fetch data from backend APIs within 3 seconds
3. IF data is loading THEN the system SHALL show loading indicators for each section
4. WHEN data fails to load THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages with retry options

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see real-time currency exchange rates, so that I can make informed decisions about international transactions.

4. WHEN the user searches transactions THEN the system SHALL filter results based on description or amount

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a backend developer, I want to provide secure API endpoints, so that the frontend can access financial data reliably.
